# Rhods Mnist Model

Notebooks and a pre train model used for lab https://github.com/adrien-legros/rhods-mnist.  
There are some required dependencies to the lab. You must at least:
- deploy the *core* manifests in order to make the notebooks and python scripts pipeline work.
- deploy also the *automated-pipelines* manifest to make the pipelines built with kfp sdk work.
